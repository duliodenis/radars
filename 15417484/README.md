#### Summary:
When going to http://www.apple.com/game-center/ the page shows "Hmm, the page you’re looking for can’t be found."

#### Steps to Reproduce:
Go to either Google or Apple.com
Search for Game Center
Select the result: http://www.apple.com/game-center/
Get a "Hmm, the page you’re looking for can’t be found." result page.

The end-user Game Center page.

#### Actual Results:
The "Hmm, the page you’re looking for can’t be found." result page.
