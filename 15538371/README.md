####Summary:
The iPhone Contacts App needs the ability to add to / remove from groups as well as the ability to Add and Remove Groups themselves.
Related to this missing UI functionality is on an iPod Touch, where there is no Phone app, there is no ability to go to Favorites.

####Steps to Reproduce:
Favorites on an iPod Touch:
1. From an iPod Touch go to a Contact and 'Add to Favorites.'
2. Now what? There is no interface to Address Book for this.

####Groups Management:
1. Can not add a contact on an iPhone.
2. Once you have a contact you can not add a contact to a Group.
3. Once you have a contact in a Group you can not remove that contact from the Group.


####Expected Results:
In order to compete with Android the iPhone needs to have its stock application be free from requiring desktop access to functionality. Needing to sync to iTunes or iCloud or Desktop Contacts usage should not be required. Contact Management on iPhone is a critical necessity.

####Actual Results:
None of the test cases above are possible in current iOS 7.
